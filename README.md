# IEC 61499 State-Based PLC Design – Lab Project

This project focuses on developing automation logic using state-based design principles within the IEC 61499 framework. It applies Structured Text (ST), Boolean logic, and timer-driven state transitions to model and execute PLC behavior in EcoStruxure Automation Expert.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Developing expertise in the creation of automation software through state-based design, with a special emphasis on the IF-THEN-ELSE paradigm.
- Developing proficiency in the application of state-based design approaches for automation software, with a focus on the use of Boolean functions.
- Implementing requirements within the context of state-based logic and executing the changed state machine using Structured Text (ST).
- Using timer mechanisms as fundamental parts of state-based architecture.
- Mastering the modeling of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in accordance with the IEC 61499 standard and utilizing associated tools.

## 🧩 What This Lab Does

This lab implements and tests a state-driven PLC application in EcoStruxure Automation Expert.  
The work includes analyzing an existing state machine, extending it with improved logic, and incorporating timer functions to control transitions. The finished application is deployed and executed in a simulated environment, where the HMI can be used to observe and influence state behavior.

## 📝 Lab Tasks

### **Task 1 — Study and Enhance the Existing State-Based Design**
Examining the current PLC state machine, understanding its transitions and Boolean conditions, and then improving or modifying its logic using IEC 61499 Function Blocks and Structured Text.

### **Task 2 — Update the Application to Use a Timer**
Extending the state machine by adding timer-based behaviour, integrating timing mechanisms into the transition logic to control state changes.
